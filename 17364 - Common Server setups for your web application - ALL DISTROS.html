    <h1>Common Servers Setup for Web Application - ALL DISTROS</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Difficulty</strong>:
        <em><u>1</u></em>
        <br />
        <strong>Time</strong>:
        <em><u>0.3</u></em>
    </p>
    <p>This article gives you some understanding on the common user server setups, their pros and cons.</p>
   
    <h2>All in One</h2>
    <p>There are three components in typical application to be deployed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application Server</li>
        <li>Web Server</li>
        <li>Database Server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This setup can be achieved by installing a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). </p>
    <p class="note">This setup could potentially reduce performance and may create difficulty in identifying the cause.</p>
    
    <h2>Keep database separate</h2>
    <p>
        It is important to keep the database separate in a server inside a private network 
        other than that running the aplication
        that ensures elevated security. 
        It also ensures that resources aren't shared and hence an 
        better performance compared to that of "All in One" setup. 
        Although the setup is more complex, it leverages additional resources to increase capacity, 
        thereby improving performance.
    </p>
    <p>Please refer to <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network</code> for more information on Private Network</p>
    <p class="note">Because the servers are isolated, this setup can create connectivity issues.</p>
    <h2>Add a load balancer</h2>
    <p>
    <p class="note">Load balancing is a core networking solution that distributes 
    incoming requests among multiple servers hosting the same application.</p>
    <p>
        Including in a load balancer 
        to the server architecture can improve performance. 
        The load balancer can quickly switch to the failover 
        to serve the request when the primary server fails until 
        the primary server can come back up online to serve requests again.
         It also enables the use of same domain and port to serve requests from multiple applications.
    </p>
    <p>
     This setup offers complete control on the requests and could possibly protect against denial of service.</p>
    <p class="note">This setup could have a negative affect performance if it isn't configured efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Use a HTTP accelerator</h2>
    <p class="note">
        Web Accelerator is a proxy server that reduces the access time by caching the response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also known as as "caching HTTP," reverse proxy is used to reduce the time to serve a request, 
        as it caches the responses in memory.
        This ensures responses can be reused for repeated requests of same type. 
        This can protect against Denial of Service attacks and can be used as reverse proxy load balancer.
    </p>
    <p class="note">This setup might not improve the performance signficantly,
     if the cached responses are never requested.</p>
    <h2>Master-subordinate replication</h2>
    <p>
        This setup needs one master and several subordinate nodes to be distribute the request across available nodes. 
        This improves the read performance of a database system.
    </p>
    <p>It offers complete control on the requests to could possibly protect against denial of service</p>
    <p class="note">The subordinates become inaccessible if the master fails.</p>
