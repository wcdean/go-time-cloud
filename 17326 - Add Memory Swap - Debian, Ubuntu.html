  <p>Getting started on adding swap space on Ubuntu to simulate additional memory and ultimately increase server optimization.</p>      
     <h1>Add Memory Swap - Debian, Ubuntu</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: <em><u>2</u></em><br/>
        <strong>Time</strong>: <em><u>15 minutes</u></em></p>
  
    <p>If you’re trying to improve your server’s performance, adding swap space (or memory swap) is a powerful and relatively simply place to start.</p>
    
    <p>Swap space is a dedicated portion of your server’s hard drive where the operating system can dump the contents of its RAM to – once the RAM gets full.  To understand the real benefit of that, you need to be familiar with processor architecture – but a brief explanation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM provides data to the processor quickly, which makes it very valuable.</li>
        <li>Once your RAM is full it needs to either delete or move the data elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Deleting the data from RAM it must be found and retrieved from the hard drive (which is slow) the next time the data is requested.</li>
        <li>By moving the data to a swap space instead of simply deleting it from RAM, it’s much faster to find the data the next time it’s requested.</li>
        <li>Moving data from RAM to the swap space consumes the processor’s resources, so doing it continually will actually degrade your application’s performance.</li>       
    </ul>
    
    <p>Though the functional differences are minute, for the sake of clarity, this article walks you through create a <em>swap file</em> – not a <em>swap partition</em>.</p>

<h2>Check current swap space usage</h2>
<p>To prevent any issues when adding swap, first check that your system does not have already have a swap space enabled.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find any swap space on the drive:
    <div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s</div></li>
</ul>

<p>If the results are empty,  the output looks similar to the following example, and you currently have no swap space enabled:</p>
  <div class="hacker"><pre>Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority</pre></div>
 
<p>If your system does have configured swap, the results look like this example:</p>
    <div class="hacker"><pre>Filename           Type         Size      Used  Priority
/dev/sda7          partition    123450    100   -1</pre></div></li>

<h2>Check your available space</h2>
<p>Now that you're ready to create a swap file, you need to find out space your server's hard drive has.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the amount of space available on the server:
    <div class="hacker">df -h</div></li>
</ul> 

<p>This command shows the free space on your hard disk. In the following example, you have 40 GB available. Make sure that there is enough free space for your swap file. The space you need depends on your requirements but, in general, an amount equal to or double the amount of RAM on your system is a good starting point.</p>

<div class="hacker"><pre>
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on    
/dev/vda         50G  10G   40G   20% /             
none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup  
udev            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /dev           
tmpfs           396M  312K  396M   1% /run    
none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock  
none            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/shm  
none            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user      
</pre></div>


<h2>Create a swap file</h2>

<p>Add swap space to your system by creating a file called <code>swapfile</code> in your root (/) directory and assigning it as swap. You will allocate the amount of space you want for your swap file. There are two commands you can use to create swap files: <code>fallocate</code> and <code>dd</code>.</p>


<h3>Create a swap file using fallocate</h3>
<p>You can gain more file space with <code>fallocate</code>, a command used to manipulate file space. The <code>fallocate</code> command creates a file of a preallocated size instantly without initializing any of it, versus the <code>dd</code> command, which takes longer because it has to write zeroes as dummy contents. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Create the file to be used for swap. For this example, we add a 4 GB file:
    <div class="hacker">sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile</div></li>

  <li>Verify that the correct amount of space was reserved:
    <div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile</div>
  
  This result shows that the file was added with the correct amount of space set aside:
    <div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:52 /swapfile </div>

  If, on the other hand, your output shows "0" like the example below, it means the swapfile created has 0 GB:
    <div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 0 Jul 08 10:52 /swapfile </div>

  If you get a failure message saying <code>fallocate failed: Operation not supported</code>, 
 your file system doesn't currently support <code>fallocate</code> (for example, ext3). Use the more traditional way with the <code>dd</code> command instead. (This situation should be rare.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Create a swap file using dd</h3>

<p>Creating a swap file using the <code>dd</code> command may not be as quick as <code>fallocate</code>, but it works. The <code>dd</code> command is one of the original UNIX disk utilities with many uses, including generating new files, copying files, and converting file formats.</p>

<p>In this example, we'll add a swap file of a different size, 1 GB, in order to accommodate smaller-sized servers. 

  <p class="note">To add a 4 GB swap file, you would need at least 1.5 GB of RAM. Always check the size of your server to make sure you have enough RAM to add swap.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add the 1 GB swap file by specifying a block size <code>bs</code> of 250 MB and a <code>count</code> of 4. <br /> 

  <p class="warning">Remember to double check your instructions! This command has the potential to destroy data if <code>of</code> (output file) points to the wrong location.</p>

    <div class="hacker">sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=250M count=4</div>

  After a few seconds, the generated output looks like this:

    <div class="hacker">4+0 records in<br />
    4+0 records out     <br />
    1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 1.47414 s, 711 MB/s</div></li>

  <li>Verify that the file was created on the server:
    <div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile</div>

  If the file was created properly, the command returns something similar to this:
    <div class="hacker">-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.0G Jul 08 10:30 swapfile</div></li>
</ol>

<h2>Enable the swap file</h2>
<p>Now that the file is created, format it as swap, and then enable it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lock the swap file's permissions so that only the root user can access it:
    <div class="hacker">sudo chmod 600 /swapfile </div>

  When first created, swap files are readable by the world, so locking permissions prevents users from reading potentially sensitive information.</li>

  <li>Verify that the file has the correct permissions: 
    <div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile  </div>
  
  The command returns something similar to this:
    <div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:40 /swapfile </div>

  This confirms that only the root has read and write flags enabled.</li>

  <li>Format that file to create a swap space:
    <div class="hacker">sudo mkswap /swapfile </div>

  If successful, the command will return something similar to this:
    <div class="hacker">Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 4194300 KiB   <br />
    no label, UUID=e2f1e9cf-c0a9-4ed4-b8ab-714b8a7d6944                       </div></li>

  <li>Mount/enable the swap space in the system:
    <div class="hacker">sudo swapon /swapfile </div></li>

  <li>Verify that the swap space was enabled by checking the system reports:
    <div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s     </div>

  The command returns something similar to this:
    <div class="hacker">Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority   <br />
swapfile               file        4194300 0       -1</div>

  You can also use the <code>free -m</code> command  to confirm that the swap is set up.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Make the swap file permanent</h2>
<p>The last crucial step is to integrate the swap file into your system's storage partitions and devices through <code>fstab</code>.

<ol>  
  <li>Open <code>fstab</code>:
    <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/fstab</div></li>

  <li>At the end of the <code>fstab</code> file, add this line to tell the  system to automatically use the newly created swap space:
    <div class="hacker">/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0</div></li>

    <li>Save and close the file:
      <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>

  </ol>

<p>After the next restart, the swap is used automatically.</p>

<h2>Tune the swap file</h2>

<p>You can tune these settings of your swap file to optimize virtual memory:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Swappiness</li>
    <li>Cache Pressure</li>
  </ul>  

<h3>Swappiness</h3>

<p>Swappiness is a setting that controls how often the swap file is used (or the tendency of the system to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk).</p>

<p>As a percentage between 0 and 100, a swappiness value of:   </p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 means swapping processes out of physical memory are avoided until absolutely necessary (memory is depleted)</li> 
    <li>100 means aggressively (almost instantly) moving swap processes out of physical memory and into the swap cache </li>
</ul>
          
<p>Interactions with the swap file are resource-intensive because they take much longer than interactions with RAM and can cause a significant reduction in system performance. Instructing your system not to overly rely on the swap can help boost overall system performance.</p>

<p>You can change your server's swapiness in <code>sysctl.conf</code>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>:
      <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div> </li>

    <li>Add at the end of the file, add this line:
      <div class="hacker">vm.swappiness=10  </div> </li>
    <li>Save and close the file:
      <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>
  </ol>

<p>To tune your application, you can test changes to your swappiness value (between 0 and 100) and running performance tests.</p>

<h3>Cache pressure</h3>
<p>Another setting is the <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code>. Changing this setting could help when the VFS (virtual file system) cache objects (called dentry and inode_cache objects) consume a larger amount of memory versus other data like page cache and swap. Because VFS cache accesses data about the file system, it's frequently requested and very resource-intensive. Thus, it's a prime setting for your system to cache.</p>

<p>The higher the value of the <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code>, the more likely your server is to use its swap.</p>

<p>You can change your server's cache pressure (again) in <code>sysctl.conf</code>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>:
      <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div> </li>

    <li>Add at the end of the file, add this line:
        <div class="hacker">vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50 </div> </li>
      <li>Save and close the file:
        <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>
    </ol>

<p>Like swappiness, you can work on increasing performance by testing different values here.</p>

<h2>Verify that swap space was enabled</h2>
<p>Check your work with any of these three commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>swapon -s</code> command:
    <div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s     </div>
  
  Output may look like this:
    <div class="hacker"><pre>Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority 
/swapfile               file        4194300 0       -1</pre></div>
  
  You'll see that a swapfile of 4 G.0 was added.</li>

  <li>For a more detailed report:
    <div class="hacker">free -m</div></li>

  <li>For a report on just swap details:
    <div class="hacker">cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Swapping can be beneficial in allowing your system to harness more memory than originally available. It's a viable option before having to optimize your application configurations, add more RAM, or upgrade your server. </p>

<p>However, remember that hard disks are much slower than RAM, and so accessing the disk often can be noticeably slower than accessing physical memory. Also, the more swapping you do, the slower your system will be. So be sure to tune your swap settings judiciously to prevent <em>swap thrashing</em> (when the hard drive is overworked by information moving excessively between system memory and virtual memory).</p>
