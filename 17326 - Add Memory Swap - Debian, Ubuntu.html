  <p>Getting started on adding swap space on Ubuntu to simulate additional memory and ultimately increase server optimization.</p>      
     <h1>Add Memory Swap - Debian, Ubuntu</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: <em><u>2</u></em><br/>
        <strong>Time</strong>: <em><u>15 minutes</u></em></p>
  
  <p>In Linux&trade;, the physical RAM is broken up into pages. The process of <em>swapping</em> happens during low-memory mode when the system swaps a section of the RAM used by an idle program onto the hard disk (a preconfigured spot referred to as <em>swap space</em>) to free up space for other essential programs.</p> 
  
  <p>There are two forms of swap space: the swap partition and swap file. A swap partition is an actual space on the hard disk dedicated only to swapping (can hold no other files), whereas a swap file is, as the name suggests, a file in your system and data files. Swap files are flexible but also can be easily damaged by a file system error. Swap space can be made up of a combination of both. The intelligent mix of RAM and swap files is called <em>virtual memory</em> and allows a system to increase the memory capacity of the original built-in RAM.   </p>
 
 
<p>This article guides you through creating and enabling a swap file on an Ubuntu server.</p>

<h2>Check current swap space usage</h2>
<p>
To prevent any issues when adding swap,  first check that your system does not have a swap file (or swap partition) that was previously activated. See your summary of swap usage with the <code>swapon</code> command or <code>free</code> command:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>swapon -s</code> if your computer is not yet set up or if you're unsure where the swap is located:
<div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s</div>
If the results are empty,  the output looks similar to the following example, and you currently have no swap space enabled: <br />
<div class="hacker"><pre>Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority</pre></div>
 
If your system does have configured swap, the results look like this example: 
<div class="hacker"><pre>
Filename           Type         Size      Used  Priority
/dev/sda7          partition    123450    100   -1
</pre></div>
 </li>
 
<li>

Use the <code>free</code> command: 
<div class="hacker">free -m</div>

The output  looks similar to this example, in which the total swap space in the system is &quot;0&quot;:<br />
<div class="hacker"><pre>
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached  
Mem:          4902        102       4800          0          8         82  
-/+ buffers/cache:         62       3890                                     
Swap:            0          0          0                              
</pre> </div>

This output matches the output from the <code>swapon -s</code> command in the first example above.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Check the file system</h2>

<ul><li>
Check the amount of space available on the server:
<div class="hacker">df -h</div>

This command shows the free space on your hard disk. In the following example, you have 40 GB available. Make sure that there is enough free space for your swap file. The space you need depends on your requirements but, in general, an amount equal to or double the amount of RAM on your system is a good starting point.  

<div class="hacker"><pre>
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on    
/dev/vda         50G  10G   40G   20% /             
none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup  
udev            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /dev           
tmpfs           396M  312K  396M   1% /run    
none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock  
none            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/shm  
none            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user      
</pre></div>

   </li></ul>   

<h2>Create a swap file</h2>

<p>Add swap space to your system by creating a file called <code>swapfile</code> in your root (/) directory and assigning it as swap. You will allocate the amount of space you want for your swap file. There are two commands you can use to create swap files: <code>fallocate</code> and <code>dd</code>.</p>


<h3>Create a swap file using <code>fallocate</code> command</h3>
<p>You can gain more file space with <code>fallocate</code>, a command used to manipulate file space. The <code>fallocate</code> command creates a file of a preallocated size instantly without initializing any of it, versus the <code>dd</code> command, which takes longer because it has to write zeros as dummy contents. </p>

<ol><li>Create the file to be used for swap. For this example, we add a 4-GB file:

<div class="hacker">sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile</div> 


</li><li>Verify that the correct amount of space was reserved: 

<div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile   </div>

This result shows that the file was added with the correct amount of space set aside:

<div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:52 /swapfile </div>

If, on the other hand, your output shows "0" like the example below, it means the swapfile created has 0 GB:
<div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 0 Jul 08 10:52 /swapfile </div>
If you get a failure message saying <code>fallocate failed: Operation not supported</code>, 
 your file system doesn't currently support <code>fallocate</code> (for example, ext3). Use the more traditional way with the <code>dd</code> command instead. (This situation should be rare.)
</li></ol>


<h3>Create a swap file using <code>dd</code> command</h3>

<p>Creating a swap file using the <code>dd</code> command may not be as quick as <code>fallocate</code>, but it works. The <code>dd</code> command is one of the original UNIX disk utilities with many uses, including generating new files, copying files, and converting file formats.</p>

<p>In this example, we'll add a swap file of a different size, 1 GB, in order to accommodate smaller-sized servers. 

  <p class="note">To add a 4 GB swap file, you would need at least 1.5 GB of RAM. Always check the size of your server to make sure you have enough RAM to add swap. <!--CT: changing 4GB to 1GB to accomodate smaller servers, per GD feedback 9/23.--></p>
<ol>
<li>
Add the 1 GB swap file by specifying a block size <code>bs</code> of 250 MB and a <code>count</code> of 4. <br /> 

  <p class="warning">Remember to double check your instructions! This command has the potential
        to destroy data if <code>of</code> (output file) points to the wrong
        location.</p>

<div class="hacker">sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=250M count=4</div>


After a few seconds, the generated output looks like this:<br />
<div class="hacker">
4+0 records in     <br />
4+0 records out     <br />
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 1.47414 s, 711 MB/s      <br />
</div> </li>

<li>Verify that the file was created on the server:

  <div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile   </div>

The command returns something similar to this:<br />
<div class="hacker">-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.0G Jul 08 10:30 swapfile   </div>

The system created the file by writing 1 GB of zeroes to the disk and, in this case, took 1 second to complete. 
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>Enable the swap file</h3>

<p>Now that the file is created, format it as swap, and then enable it.</p>

<ol>
<li> Lock the swap file's permissions so that only the root user can access it. By default, swap files are readable by the world when first created, so locking permissions prevents users from reading potentially sensitive information.

  <div class="hacker">sudo chmod 600 /swapfile </div>

</li><li>Verify that the file has the correct permissions: 

<div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile  </div>
The command returns something similar to this:<br />
<div class="hacker">
-rw------- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:40 /swapfile </div>     
This confirms that only the root has read and write flags enabled.   
</li>

<li>Format that file to create a swap space:

<div class="hacker">sudo mkswap /swapfile </div>
The command returns something similar to this:
   
<div class="hacker">Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 4194300 KiB   <br />
no label, UUID=e2f1e9cf-c0a9-4ed4-b8ab-714b8a7d6944                          </div>
</li>

<li>Mount/enable the swap space in the system:

  <div class="hacker">sudo swapon /swapfile    </div>   </li>


<li>Verify that the swap space was enabled by checking the system reports:

<div class="hacker">sudo /swapon -s        </div>


The command returns something similar to this:
<div class="hacker">
Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority   <br />
swapfile               file        4194300 0       -1
</div>

You can also use the <code>free -m</code> command  to confirm that the swap is set up.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Make the change (swap file) permanent</h2>

<ol><li>Open the <code>fstab</code> file first so you can edit it:

<div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/fstab   </div></li>

<li>At the end of the <code>fstab</code> file, add this line to tell the  system to automatically use the newly created swap space:

<div class="hacker">/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0</div></li>

<li>Save and close the file. </li></ol>After the next restart, the swap is used automatically.

<h2>Tune the swap file </h2>

You can tune these settings of your swap file to optimize virtual memory:  <br />
<ul>
<li>Swappiness</li>
<li>Cache Pressure</li>
</ul>  

<h3>Set or change the swappiness setting</h3>

<p>Swappiness is a setting that controls how often the swap file is used (or the tendency of the system to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk). </p>

<p>As a percentage between 0 and 100, a swappiness value of:   </p>
<ul>
<li>0 means swapping processes out of physical memory are avoided until absolutely necessary (memory is depleted)</li> 
<li>100 means aggressively (almost instantly) moving swap processes out of physical memory and into the swap cache </li>
</ul>
          
<p class="note">Interactions with the swap file are resource-intensive because they take much longer than interactions with RAM and can cause a significant reduction in system performance. Instructing your system not to overly rely on the swap can help boost overall system performance.      </p>

<ol>
<li>
Find your current swappiness value:

  <div class="hacker">cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness  </div>
  The system returns a value such as the following:
  <div class="hacker">60</div>

The default swappiness value for Ubuntu and Debian is 60. Reducing the value can possibly improve overall performance for a desktop and very likely improve the performance for a database server or virtual private server (VPS). Try setting the swappiness to 10 to start, and increase if needed. </li><li>

Set the swappiness to a different value with the <code>sysctl</code> command.<br />

For example, to set the swappiness to 10:   

<div class="hacker">sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10 </div>
The system returns the following:

<div class="hacker">vm.swappiness = 10     </div>

This setting takes effect on the next restart. </li>

<li>If you want to set this value automatically at restart, do the following:

<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
<li>Add the line below to your <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file:

  <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div> </li>

<li>Add at the end of the file, add this line:    

<div class="hacker">vm.swappiness=10  </div> </li>

<li>Save and close the file.</li></ol></li></ol>


<h3>Tune the cache pressure</h3>

<p>Another setting is the <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code>. Changing this setting could help when the VFS (virtual file system) cache objects (called dentry and inode_cache objects) consume a larger amount of memory versus other data like page cache and swap. Because VFS cache accesses data about the file system, it's frequently requested and very resource-intensive. Thus, it's a prime setting for your system to cache. </p>
<ol><li>Find the current cache value by querying the proc filesystem again: 
         
<div class="hacker">cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure</div>
The system returns the following: 

<div class="hacker">100</div>

At this example setting of 100, your system removes inode information from the cache too quickly. </li>

<li>Change this setting to a more conservative setting such as 50:

<div class="hacker">sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50    </div>
The system returns the following:  
<div class="hacker">vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50</div>

This change persists only for your current session. </li>

<li>If you want to set the value automatically upon restart, do the following:

<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
<li>Add the same line as in the swappiness step above:

  <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div></li>

<li>At the end of the file, add this line: 

<div class="hacker">vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50 </div> </li>

<li>Save and close the file.</li></ol></li></ol>

<!--CT: Moved to this new spot. Added to it. 8/12-->
<h2>Verify that swap space was enabled</h2>
<p>Check your work with any of these three commands:</p>

<ul><li><code>swapon -s</code> command:
<div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s        </div>
Output may look like this:
<div class="hacker"><pre>
Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority 
/swapfile               file        4194300 0       -1
</pre></div>
You'll see that a swapfile of 4 G.0 was added.
</li>

<li>For a more detailed report:
<div class="hacker">free -m</div>
</li>

<li>For a report on just swap details:
<div class="hacker">cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
    
   <p>Swapping can be beneficial in allowing your system to harness more memory than originally available. It's a viable option before having to optimize your application configurations, add more RAM, or upgrade your server. </p>

<p>However, remember that hard disks are much slower than RAM, and so accessing the disk often can be noticeably slower than accessing physical memory. Also, the more swapping you do, the slower your system will be. So be sure to tune your swap settings judiciously to prevent <em>swap thrashing</em> (when the hard drive is overworked by information moving excessively between system memory and virtual memory).
