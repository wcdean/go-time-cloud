<p>Install and configure Fail2ban for Arch Linux to increase security.</p>
    <h1>Install and Configure Fail2ban - Arch Linux</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: <em><u>2</u></em><br />
        <strong>Time</strong>: <em><u>10 minutes</u></em></p>
  
    <p>Fail2ban is an intrusion-prevention tool that scans your server’s logs and bans IP addresses from brute-force attempts based on parameters you set. At the same time, Fail2ban  updates your firewall rules on the fly to block those IPs. These prevention efforts have the added benefit of keeping unwanted traffic from taking up bandwidth on your server.</p>

  <p>  This article  guides you through a basic configuration of Fail2ban.  First, make sure that your <a href="http://git.dean.xyz/17400%20-%20Set%20up%20a%20Firewall%20using%20IPtables%20–%20ALL%20DISTROS.html">firewall (IPtables) is set up</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Fail2ban</h2> 
       <ol>
       <li>Update your local packages, and install Fail2ban using <code>pacman</code>.
         <div class="hacker">sudo pacman -Syu</div></li>
  
    <li>At the prompt, <code>Proceed with installation? [Y/n],</code> enter <strong>Y</strong> to proceed. 
         
      <div class="hacker">sudo pacman -Sy fail2ban</div></li>
    
    <li>At the prompt, <code>Proceed with installation? [Y/n],</code> enter <strong>Y</strong> to proceed. </li></ol>
         

<h2>Introduction to Fail2ban: Filters, actions, and jails</h2>
 
 <p>Before continuing, let's briefly overview  the main components used in Fail2ban. </p>
 
        <h3>  Filters</h3>

<p>Filters are conditions (regular expressions rules) that look through your logs to detect attacks. 
Fail2ban comes with filters out of the box, and you can also add your own. The predefined filters are located in <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d</code>. The actual filter values don’t have the <code>.conf</code> extension.</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>
See your available filters by listing them.
<div class="hacker">ls /etc/fail2ban/filter.d</div></li></ul>


<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Actions ban hosts if they find matches from the filters. Conversely, actions can also unban hosts. Actions are scripts in <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/</code>. Each service can have multiple actions.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>
See your actions by listing them.
  <div class="hacker">ls /etc/fail2ban/action.d</div>
The default actions are adequate for Fail2ban to work.</li></ul>

<h3>Jails</h3>

<p>Jails are a set of application-specific rules combining filters and actions to find common attacks. 
There are  predetermined rules that apply to all apps as well as application-specific rules. Specific services start at <code>[SECTION_NAME]</code>. If a service is enabled, the line under the service says 
<code>enabled = true</code>. If the service is disabled, the line says <code>enabled = false</code>.</p> 

<p>If there is a service you want to enable, change the line under the service to <code>enabled = true</code>. SSH is the one service that’s enabled by default, meaning that SSH protection is on.</p>

<h2>Configure Fail2ban</h2>
<p>Now that you understand Fail2ban's terminology, let’s set up a basic configuration.
</p>
<h3>Open the configuration file </h3>
<ol>
<li>Duplicate the Fail2ban configuration file so that you can make changes to your local copy only.
  <div class="hacker">sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local</div>
This  backup copy keeps your default file safe and intact. </li>
<li>Open the jail file so that you can make changes. 
  <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local</div>      

 </li>
                                           
      </ol>
  
  You'll work within this configuration file to change  settings. 
  
  <h3>Modify jail settings</h3> 
Find the following lines in the configuration<code></code> file, and modify as needed with these recommended settings:
<ul>  

<li><strong><code>ignoreip</code></strong>: Whitelisted IPs. Add your own IP so that you don’t accidentally ban yourself. You can also add the IPs of any of your virtual hosts. By default, only 127.0.0.1 (the local host) is ignored. Use <code>ignoreip</code> to add these IPs, separating each address with a space. For example:
  <div class="hacker">ignoreip = 127.0.0.0 127.0.0.2 </div></li>

<li><strong><code>findtime</code></strong>, <strong><code>Maxretry</code></strong>: When a given number of attempts (<code>maxretry</code>)  are made within a certain period (<code>findtime</code>), that IP is banned for a time set by <code>bantime</code>. The default setting of <code>findtime</code> is 10 minutes, indicated by the line <code>findtime = 600</code> in your file. The default maxretry is <code>3</code>.</li>

<li><strong><code>bantime</code></strong>: The amount of time (in seconds) a banned user is locked out. The default setting is 10 minutes, indicated by the line <code>bantime = 600</code> in your file. Change this to a higher lockout time, if you like. To set your lockout period to 1 day (24 hours), for instance, change the <code>bantime</code> setting to 86400. Users set their bantime anywhere from an hour to a year. You can even use a negative number, such as -1, for a permanent ban.
  <p>Here is an example configuration:</p>

<div class="hacker">maxretry = 3</div>
<div class="hacker">findtime = 10800 </div>
<div class="hacker">bantime = 86400 </div>
                                             
Any IP with three failed login attempts within 10800 seconds (3 hours) is banned for 86400 seconds (1 day). This setting is stricter  than the default.   
  </li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Modify actions</h3> 

In the <code>ACTIONS</code> section, you can change your default action to either of the following:<br />   

<ul>
<li><code>action_mw</code>: Ban and email notify with the <code>whois</code> report (IPs)    </li>
<li><code>action_mwl</code>: Ban and email notify with the <code>whois</code> report and relevant log lines (if you want to troubleshoot).    </li>

  </ul>

<p>Let's choose <code>action_mwl</code> so you have more information for troubleshooting. Find this line, located at the very end of the <code>ACTIONS</code> section, right before <code>JAILS</code>:</p>
<div class="hacker">action = %(action_)s</div>
 Then change it to:
 <div class="hacker">action = %( action_mwl)s</div> 

This change makes a ban and an email alert (with relevant log lines) the default action.
  
  
  <h3>Modify email alerts</h3> 
   
<p>You just set your default action to include email alerts. Now you can update the destination email address that notifies you of bans. </p>
<p><code>destemail</code> indicates where your alerts are sent. Find <code>destemail = root@localhost</code> in your file, and replace <code>root@localhost</code> with your own email address. </p>

<p>Note that by default the email messages  are sent by root@localhost, as stated in your file:</p>
<div class="hacker"># Sender email address used solely for some actions
sender = root@localhost                                 </div>


<p>You can change this default by modifying the <code>sender</code> value.</p>

   <h3>Load your new configuration</h3> 
<p>Once you finish modifying the configuration file, restart Fail2ban so that the changes  take effect.</p>

<ol>
<li>Save and close the configuration file. </li>  

<li>Restart Fail2ban.
  <div class="hacker">sudo systemctl start fail2ban</div>
</li>
 <li>Enable Fail2ban so that it  runs when your system starts.  
   <div class="hacker">sudo systemctl enable fail2ban</div>
 </li>
 
 <li>     Optionally, check the status.
   <div class="hacker">sudo systemctl status fail2ban</div>
      You should see a message such as <code>Active: active (running)</code> within the  output. </li>
 </ol>
<p>Fail2ban starts automatically on each server restart.</p>
