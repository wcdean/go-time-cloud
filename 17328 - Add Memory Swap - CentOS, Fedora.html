<p>Getting started on adding swap space on CentOS or Fedora to simulate additional memory and ultimately increase server optimization. </p>
<h1>Add Memory Swap - CentOS, Fedora</h1>
  <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>:<em> 2</em><br />
<strong>Time</strong>: <em>15 minutes</em></p>
  
    <p>If you’re trying to improve your server’s performance, adding swap space (or memory swap) is a powerful and relatively simply place to start.</p>
    
    <p>Swap space is a dedicated portion of your server’s hard drive where the operating system can dump the contents of its RAM to – once the RAM gets full.  To understand the real benefit of that, you need to be familiar with processor architecture – but a brief explanation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM provides data to the processor quickly, which makes it very valuable.</li>
        <li>Once your RAM is full it needs to either delete or move the data elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Deleting the data from RAM it must be found and retrieved from the hard drive (which is slow) the next time the data is requested.</li>
        <li>By moving the data to a swap space instead of simply deleting it from RAM, it’s much faster to find the data the next time it’s requested.</li>
        <li>Moving data from RAM to the swap space consumes the processor’s resources, so doing it continually will actually degrade your application’s performance.</li>				
    </ul>
    
    <p>Though the functional differences are minute, for the sake of clarity, this article walks you through create a <em>swap file</em> – not a <em>swap partition</em>.</p>
 

<h2>Check current swap space usage</h2>
<p>To prevent any issues when adding swap, first check that your system does not have already have a swap space enabled.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Find any active swap space on the drive:
		<div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s</div></li>
</ul>

<p>You may get an output like this:</p>
	<div class="hacker"><pre>Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority </pre></div>

<p>Or, you may get no output at all. Both mean you do not currently have any swap space enabled.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the results if your system does have configured swap:
	<div class="hacker"><pre>Filename           Type         Size      Used  Priority 
/dev/sda7          partition    123450    100   -1</pre></div>   

<h2>Check your available space</h2>
<p>Now that you're ready to create a swap file, you need to find out space your server's hard drive has.</p>
	<ul>
      <li>Check the amount of space available on the server:
        <div class="hacker">df -h</div></li>
    </ul>

<p>The results tell us the space usage and availability in M (for MB) or G (for GB). In this example, you have 40 GB available.</p>
	<div class="hacker"><pre>Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on 
/dev/vda         50G  10G   40G   20% /                                    
none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup  
udev            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /dev            
tmpfs           396M  312K  396M   1% /run           
none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock      
none            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/shm       
none            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user</pre></div>

<p>The space you need depends on your requirements, but in general start with an amount equal to or double the amount of RAM on your system.</p>


<h2>Create a swap file</h2>

<p>After establishing you have available storage space, you can add a swap file to your system. You'll do this by creating a file called <code>swapfile</code> in your root (/) directory and assigning it as swap. You will allocate the amount of space you want for your swap file. </p> 

<p>There are two ways to add swap files: use the <code>fallocate</code> command or use the <code>dd</code> command.</p>

<p class="warning">The <code>fallocate</code> command has <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1129205">unresolved bugs</a> in CentOS 7. CentOS 7 users should instead use the <code>dd</code> command to create their swap file.</p>

<h3>Create a swap file using fallocate</h3>
You can gain more file space with the <code>fallocate</code> command - used to manipulate file space. The <code>fallocate</code> creates a file of a preallocated size instantly, without having to write dummy contents. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Create the file to be used for swap. For this example, we will add a 4 GB file.
		<div class="hacker">sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile</div></li>
	<li>Verify the correct amount of space was reserved.
		<div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile   </div></li>
</ol>
<p>Your output will look something like this:</p>
<div class="hacker">-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:52 /swapfile </div>

<p>The file was added with the correct amount of space set aside.</p>

<p>Rarely, you get a failure message: <code>fallocate failed: Operation not supported</code>. This means your file system doesn't currently support <code>fallocate</code> (for example, ext3). Use the more traditional method with the <code>dd</code> command instead. </p>

<h3>Create a swap file using dd</h3>
<p>The traditional method of creating a swap file with preallocated space is to use the <code>dd</code> command. Even though it may not be as quick as <code>fallocate</code>, it's a versatile disk utility that writes from one location to another.</p>

<ol>
	<li>To add a swap file the size of 4 GB, specify a block size <code>bs</code> of "1 GB" and a <code>count</code> of "4." 
		<p class="warning">Double-check this particular command because it has the potential to destroy data if the <code>of</code> command (output file) is pointed to the wrong location.</p>

		<div class="hacker">sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=4</div>

	You'll likely have to wait a few seconds, but once it generates, the output will look like:
		<div class="hacker"><pre>4+0 records in
4+0 records out  
4094967296 bytes (4.1 GB) copied, 18.0017 s, 215 MB/s</pre></div> </li>

	<li>Verify the file has been created on the server.
		<div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile   </div>

	Your output should look like:
		<div class="hacker">-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:53 /swapfile</div></li>
</ol>

<p>The system created the file by writing 4 GB of zeroes to the disk.</p>


<h2>Enable the swap file</h2>
<p>Now that your swap file's been created, tell the system to format your file as swap, and then enable it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lock the swap file's permissions so that only the root user can access it:
    <div class="hacker">sudo chmod 600 /swapfile </div>

  When first created, swap files are readable by the world, so locking permissions prevents users from reading potentially sensitive information.</li>
	<li>Verify that the file has the correct permissions.
		<div class="hacker">ls -lh /swapfile  </div>
	Look for your output, which will resemble:
		<div class="hacker">-rw------- 1 root root 4.0G Jul 08 10:40 /swapfile </div>

	This example confirms that only the root has read and write flags enabled.</li>

	<li>Format that file to create a swap space.
		<div class="hacker">sudo mkswap /swapfile </div>

	If successful, the command will return something similar to this:
		<div class="hacker">Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 4194300 KiB<br />
		no label, UUID=e2f1e9cf-c0a9-4ed4-b8ab-714b8a7d6944</div></li>

	<li>Mount/enable the swap space in the system.
		<div class="hacker">sudo swapon /swapfile</div></li>
</ol>
 
<h2>Make the swap file permanent</h2>
<p>The last crucial step is to integrate the swap file into your system's storage partitions and devices through <code>fstab</code>.

<ol>  
  <li>Open <code>fstab</code>:
    <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/fstab</div></li>

	<li>At the end of the file, tell the operating system to automatically use the newly-created swap space.
		<div class="hacker">/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0   </div> </li>
	<li>Save and close the file:
      <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>
</ol>

<p>After the next reboot, the swap will be used automatically.</p>

<h2>Tune the swap file</h2>

<p>You can tune the following settings of your swap file to optimize virtual memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Swappiness</li>
<li>Cache pressure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Swappiness</h3>

<p>Swappiness is a setting that controls how often the swap file is used (or the tendency of the system to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk).</p>

<p>As a percentage between 0 and 100, a swappiness value of:   </p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 means swapping processes out of physical memory are avoided until absolutely necessary (memory is depleted)</li> 
    <li>100 means aggressively (almost instantly) moving swap processes out of physical memory and into the swap cache </li>
</ul>
          
<p>Interactions with the swap file are resource-intensive because they take much longer than interactions with RAM and can cause a significant reduction in system performance. Instructing your system not to overly rely on the swap can help boost overall system performance.</p>

<p>You can change your server's swapiness in <code>sysctl.conf</code>.</p>

<ol> 
  <li>Open your <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file:
		<div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div> </li>

	<li>Add at the end of the file, add this text:
		<div class="hacker">vm.swappiness=10  </div>  </li>
	<li>Save and close the file:
      <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>
</ol>

<p>To tune your application, you can test changes to your swappiness value (between 0 and 100) and running performance tests.</p>

<h3>Cache pressure</h3>
<p>Another setting is the <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code>. Changing this setting could help when the VFS (virtual file system) cache objects (called dentry and inode_cache objects) consume a larger amount of memory versus other data like page cache and swap. Because VFS cache accesses data about the file system, it's frequently requested and very resource-intensive. Thus, it's a prime setting for your system to cache.</p>

<p>The higher the value of the <code>vfs_cache_pressure</code>, the more likely your server is to use its swap.</p>

<p>You can change your server's cache pressure (again) in <code>sysctl.conf</code>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>:
      <div class="hacker">sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</div> </li>

    <li>Add at the end of the file, add this line:
        <div class="hacker">vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50 </div> </li>
      <li>Save and close the file:
        <div class="hacker">:wq!</div></li>
    </ol>

<p>Like swappiness, you can work on increasing performance by testing different values here.</p>

<h2>Verify swap space was enabled</h2>

<p>Check your work with any of these three commands:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For a general report:
		<div class="hacker">sudo swapon -s</div>
	Output may look like this:
		<div class="hacker"><pre>Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority 
/swapfile               file        4194300 0       -1</pre></div>
			
	You'll see that a swap file of 4 G.0 was added.</li>

	<li>For a more detailed report:
		<div class="hacker">free -m</div></li>

	<li>For a report on just swap details:
		<div class="hacker">cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Swapping enables you to increase the amount of information that your server can keep in its working memory. Even though reading from and writing to swap is slower than using actual memory, swap can be a good safety net for the times your server is low on memory.</p>

<p>Remember that hard disks have a slower memory than RAM and so you should tune your swap settings judiciously to prevent swap thrashing (when the hard drive is overworked by information moving excessively between system memory and virtual memory).</p>
