<!--TingTing, the structure and content are very close to the Digital Ocean article. Can you revamp the information so that it is original work? The instructions from GoDaddy say that the article should cover "Setting up Backups, Logging, Monitoring, and Load Balancing on a production server." The information doesn't have to be presented as five steps. 

Also, I'm not sure that we want to link to articles on blogs, etc. I've asked Sean on Slack for some guidelines. 

Also, some of the sentence structure is a little off--can you double-check it? For example, "For demonstration purpose, let's assume that we're have a setup of two-server environment" should be something like "For demonstration purposes, let's assume that we have a two-server environment . . . "

Thanks, Carla

    <p>This tutorial will introduce some important components that can be used to imporove your production server. For demonstration purpose, let's assume that we're have a setup  of two-server environment that simply serves a web application, one for app and the other one for database.</p>

    <!-- Sections start with h2 -->
    <h2>Production Environment</h2>
    <p>A server environment for a web application consists of the hardware, software, data, operational plans which keep the application working. A production environment usually refers to a server environment that was designed and optimized from the following perspectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Availability: </strong> The ability to be usable by its intended users. Availability can be impacted by any failure that affects a critical component. Decreasing the number of single points of failure in an environmentOne can improve availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Recoverability: </strong> The ability to recover an application environment in the event of system failure or data loss. Improving maintainability and reduces the time to perform the recovery process in the event of a failure, which can improve availability in the event of a failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The application performs as expected under average or peak load.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <h3>1. Backup System</h3>
    <p> Backup system gives you the ability to create periodic backups of your data, and restore data from backups. Backups also allow for rolling back data to a previous state, in the event of accidental deletion or bad modification. All computer hardware has a chance of failure at some point in time, which can potentially cause data loss. Therefore, you should always keep recent backups of all the important data. It is required for production. Together with solid recovery plans,  a backup system can significantly lower the impact of data loss. </p>
    <p>In a basic backup system, the backup server usually sits in the same data center as the application servers, where the initial backups are created. Off-site copies of the backups are made afterwards to different location servers, so that the data is preserved in some unexpected events.</p>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What to backup:</strong> Choose the data that needs to back up. Usually any data that you can't reliably reproduce from an another  source will need to back up.</li>
        <li><strong>When to backup:</strong> When and how frequently you will perform backups.</li>
        <li><strong>How long to keep the data:</strong> How long to keep the backups before deleting.</li>
        <li><strong>how much disk spaces require:</strong> All three items mentioned before affect the amount of disk space your backup system needs. Compression and incremental backups could be good ways to decrease the required disk spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Off-site Backups:</strong> In order to protect your backups against local disasters, you need to maintain a copy of your backups in a geographically separate location. </li>
        <li><strong>Backup Restoration Tests:</strong> Test your backup restoration process regularly to make sure that your backups data work properly</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>


    <h3>2. Recovery Plans</h3>
    <p>Recovery plans are documented procedures to recover from failures or unintended administration actions within the production environment. For example, a  basic recovery plan for a server failure includes the steps to perform your initial server deployment, as well as procedures for restoring application data from backups. In addition to good documentation, taking advantage of deployment scripts and configuration management tools to help automate and quicken the recovery process. It is required for production as they help you use backup systems effectively, and provide a guideline for rebuilding your environment or rolling back to a good state in the event of failures.</p>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Procedure Documentation:</strong> The documents that should be followed in a failure event. A good practice is to write a step-by-step document that can be followed to rebuild a failed server, then to add steps for restoring the data and configuration from backups</li>
        <li><strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Scripts and configuration management software provide automation, which can greatly improve the speed and consistency of recovery processes compared to step-by-step guides operated by a person.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Components:</strong> The components that make your application function properly. In same cases, both the application and database servers are critical components because if either fails, the application will become unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Points of Failure:</strong> Critical components that do not have an automatic failover mechanism are defined as a single point of failure. You should try to eliminate single points of failure to improve availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Updates:</strong> Update your documentation as your deployment and recovery process change.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Load Balancing</h3>
    <p>Load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources. You can add looad balancing to a server environment to improve performance. If one of the servers fails, the other servers will take over the incoming traffic until the failed server is available again. In a cloud server environment, load balancing  is usually implemented by adding a load balancer server running load balancer (reverse proxy) software in front of multiple servers. It is not required for production, but it can be a great way to reduce the number of single points failure and improve the peformance by scale the capability horizontally.</p>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Load Balanceable Components:</strong> Not all components in an environment can be load balanced easily. You need to make special consideration  for certain types of software.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Replication:</strong> If a load balanced application server stores data locally, then this data must be made available to the other application servers to ensure that the application data will be available on  application server which is chosen to serve a user request.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> If a load balancer does not have enough resources or is configured improperly, it can actually decrease the performance of the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Points of Failure:</strong> Poorly planned or configured load balancing can add more single points of failure instead of eliminating it.</li>

    <h3>4. Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Monitoring can track the status of services and the trends of your server resource utilization, thus providing great visibility into your environment. They can be configured to trigger an action, such as sending a notification, when a service or server goes down, or if a certain resource, such as CPU, memory becomes over used. These notifications enable you to react to any issues as soon as they happen, which can help reduce or prevent the downtime of your application. It is not required for production. However, as a production environment grows it can help keep track of the critical services and resources, therefore improving the recoverability.</p>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Services to Monitor:</strong> Minimally, you need to monitor state of services that are essential for your application to run properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Resources to Monitor:</strong> Examples of resources you will monitor include CPU, memory, storage, network utilization, and the  server status  as a whole.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> The period of time that you retain monitoring data before deleting it. Along with items to monitor, it will affect the amount of disk space required for the monitoring system.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Detection Rules:</strong> The thresholds and rules that determine the state of a service or resource. For example, a service may be considered to be healthy if it is serving requests properly, while a resource might trigger a warning if its utilization reaches the given threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification Rules:</strong> The thresholds and rules that determine when to sent out a notification. It is important to tune your notification rules so that you don't receive too many, which will often be ignored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Centralized Logging</h3>
    <p>Centralized logging  provides an easy way to view and search your logs in a single place, which are normally stored  on individual servers across the environment. Besides the convenience of not having to log in to individual servers, centralized logging also help you identify issues that exist across multiple servers by correlating their logs and metrics. It is not required for production. However, as the server environment grows, it enables you to audit the server logs with greater visibility and faster speed.</p>
    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Logs to Gather:</strong> The particular logs that you will ship from your servers to the centralized logging server. You should gather the important logs from all of your servers</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> The period of time that you retain log data before deleting it. Along with log content to collect, it will affect the amount of disk space required for the logging system.</li>
        <li><strong>Log Filters:</strong> The filters that parse plain logs into structured log data. It will improve your capability to query, analyze, and graph the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Clocks:</strong> The time of your servers needs to be synchronized and set to the same time zone, so your log timeline is accurate across your entire environment.</li>
    </ul>
